### Description:
This project aims to predict **financial risk** for individuals based on various factors and features like **City, Location_score, Internal_Audit_Score, External_Audit_Score, Fin_Score, Loss_Score, and past results**. By utilizing machine learning techniques like **Classification**, we can make informed predictions about a person's creditworthiness and financial stability.

### Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Risk prediction using trained models
- Web interface for interacting with the model. [Streamlit](https://project4financialclassification-mtqio3decfarzrqnsx3myd.streamlit.app/)

### Usage
Once the Streamlit application is running, you will be presented with a user interface containing input fields for various features. Enter the relevant details, such as the **City, Location_score, Internal_Audit_Score, External_Audit_Score, Fin_Score, Loss_Score, and past results** then click on the "Predict" button. The application will utilize the trained Logistic Regression model to generate the prediction for the person based on the provided features.
